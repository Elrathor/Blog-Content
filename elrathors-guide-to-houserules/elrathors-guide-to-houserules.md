- X - Card always applies
- No flying
- Max out one of the dice sets for crit. damage
- Death Saving Throws are rolled by the gamemaster

This is a short set of rules used in all my future Pen and Paper Roleplay sessions. They attempt to improve storytelling and provide fun for every player at the table. Most of them are tailored to fit games played in the confines of Dungeon & Dragons 5th Edition, but especially rule number one applies to absolutely **every** game no matter the system.

# X - Card always applies
Every game, it doesn't matter if it's a horror one or not, uses the [X - Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg) as written by John Stavropoulos.

_A pen and paper roleplaying game should be a safe environment for everyone. This tries to keep it this way._

# No flying
You can't choose any class or race feature, that increases your characters' fly speed above 0ft at character creation. Any items, cantrips or spells are not affected by this ruling.

_This rule exists to even the playing field for new players and enables everyone on the table to explore the same areas, regardless of class or race._

# Better Critical Hits
When you score a critical hit (roll a 20 on your hit roll), roll for damage normally. Add the result to the maximum you could have rolled before applying any modifiers. Finally, apply any modifiers to get your critical hit damage.

_Example: If your normal damage would be 1D6+1, your critical damage would become 1D6 + 6 + 1. Credit: This rule was created by [Kelly McLaughlin and Monty Martin](https://www.youtube.com/c/DungeonDudes/featured); also known as The Dungeon Dudes._

# More dramatic death saves
When your HP drops to 0 your Death Saving Throws are roled by your game master in secret. No additional rulings are applied.

_This rule tries to prevent the "Oh he has already two successful Death Saves, I won't help him" problem and attempts to make situations like going unconscious more dramatic_

**Important**: If I have the honor to be your gamemaster, make sure to check in with me in session zero weather we'll use all of the above or have special per-group rulings that will take their place.
